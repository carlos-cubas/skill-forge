# General Validation Tests
#
# These tests validate general assumptions about SkillForge that are not
# specific to any framework (CrewAI or LangChain).
#
# Assumptions validated:
# 1. CLI startup time is acceptable for runtime usage
# 2. skillforge read CLI is fast enough for runtime usage
# 3. Skill content fits in context window
# 4. Agents follow meta-skill instructions reliably
#
# See docs/plans/2025-12-04-skillforge-design.md for full context.
