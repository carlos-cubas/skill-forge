/ralph-loop:ralph-loop "Consider the design documents docs/plans Tasks: 1. Answer: what do I need to do next to bring the designs to life? 2. Read existing github issues open and closed, understand how they form a cohesive implementation plan 3. Create/update github issues with task details, properly sequenced (use superpowers:writing-plans skill) Definition of "best in class" plan: - STRUCTURAL: All design doc sections covered, dependencies sequenced, actionable steps with code - EMPIRICAL: Plan includes issues that PROVE the system works end-to-end with REAL API calls (not mocked, not dry-runs, not manual verification) - VALIDATION: At least one issue runs the full pipeline (scenario → real API → real evaluation → results) and asserts concrete outcomes Success Criteria: Use a sub-agent to review the plan against BOTH structural AND empirical criteria. The sub-agent MUST verify: - [ ] All design sections have corresponding issues - [ ] At least one issue requires real API integration test (not mocked) - [ ] At least one issue validates thresholds against real data - [ ] No critical validation is deferred to "manual" or "dry-run" Only output <promise>COMPLETED</promise> when the sub-agent confirms BOTH structural completeness AND empirical validation coverage." --max-iterations 30 --completion-promise "COMPLETED"
