# Troubleshooting Skill

Systematically diagnose and resolve common customer support issues using a structured approach.

## When to Use

- Customer reports a technical problem
- Issue requires step-by-step diagnosis
- Common problems: email sync, password reset, login/access issues
- Before escalating to specialized support

## Instructions

1. **Listen and clarify** - Understand the exact issue before troubleshooting
2. **Restate the problem** - Confirm your understanding with the customer
3. **Follow diagnosis steps** - Work through checks systematically
4. **Document findings** - Note what was tried and results
5. **Resolve or escalate** - Provide solution or escalate with context

## Common Issue Frameworks

### Email Sync Issues
1. Verify account credentials are correct
2. Check internet connectivity status
3. Confirm email server settings (IMAP/SMTP)
4. Clear email app cache and restart
5. Test with web-based email access

### Password Reset Problems
1. Confirm the email address on file
2. Check spam/junk folder for reset email
3. Verify account is not locked
4. Try alternative reset methods (SMS, security questions)
5. Manual reset if automated methods fail

### Login/Access Issues
1. Confirm username/email is correct
2. Check for caps lock or keyboard issues
3. Verify account status (active, suspended, expired)
4. Test in incognito/private browser mode
5. Clear browser cache and cookies
